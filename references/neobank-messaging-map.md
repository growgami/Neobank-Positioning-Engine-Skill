## Unclaimed Territories (Opportunities)

Based on the gap analysis across all mapped companies:

1. **"Transparent fees"** — Every neobank buries fees. Nobody leads with radical fee transparency. Revolut got fined for misleading fee displays. This is open territory.

2. **"Provably safe"** — Post-FTX, post-Synapse. Real-time proof of reserves, published audits, on-chain transparency. Coinbase hints at this but doesn't own it in messaging.

3. **"Crypto without the crypto"** — An app that gives crypto benefits (yield, global transfers, no intermediary) without requiring users to understand or interact with crypto. The opposite of "DeFi made easy."

4. **"Your bank account, auditable"** — Combine self-custody philosophy with banking UX. Show users exactly where their money is at all times. Not "trust us" but "verify yourself."

5. **"Built for [specific region]"** — Most crypto neobanks position globally. Regional specificity (LatAm remittances, SEA card access, Africa mobile money) is underexploited.

6. **"The anti-bank for [specific frustration]"** — Position against a specific banking pain point (overdraft fees, currency conversion rip-offs, 3-day transfers) rather than against "banks" generically.
