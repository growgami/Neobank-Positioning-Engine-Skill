# Positioning Frameworks Reference

## 1. Geoffrey Moore's Positioning Statement

From "Crossing the Chasm" (1991). Still the clearest structure for B2C positioning.

```
For [target customer]
who [statement of need or opportunity],
[product name] is a [product category]
that [statement of key benefit].
Unlike [primary competitive alternative],
our product [statement of primary differentiation].
```

The power is in the constraints. Each slot forces a choice. "For everyone" is not a target customer. "Better" is not a differentiation.

**How to use for crypto neobanks:**
- Target customer = specific persona, not "crypto users"
- Need = emotional, not functional ("protect my money from peso depreciation" not "buy crypto")
- Category = strategic choice (are you a "bank"? a "wallet"? a "financial app"?)
- Key benefit = one thing, not a feature list
- Alternative = what they use today, not your closest competitor
- Differentiation = must fail the competitor test (could they say the same thing?)

## 2. April Dunford's Positioning Framework

From "Obviously Awesome" (2019). Works backwards from differentiated capabilities.

**Five components:**
1. **Competitive alternatives**: What would customers use if you didn't exist? (Not just direct competitors. Spreadsheets, doing nothing, asking a friend.)
2. **Unique attributes**: What do you have that alternatives don't? (Technical capabilities, not benefits.)
3. **Value**: What do those unique attributes enable for customers? (The "so what?" of each attribute.)
4. **Target customer characteristics**: Who cares most about this value? (The segment where your unique attributes matter most.)
5. **Market category**: What context makes your value obvious? (This frames everything. "Crypto bank" vs "spending app" vs "wealth protection tool" changes perception.)

**How to use for crypto neobanks:**
Start with competitive alternatives. If users currently use Revolut + Coinbase separately, that's the alternative. Position against the gap between them, not against either one.

## 3. Territory Mapping

Positioning territories are conceptual spaces a brand can "own" in the customer's mind. Once owned, they're expensive for competitors to take.

**Common territories in crypto neobanks:**

| Territory | Who Owns It | Strength |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| "The everything app" | Revolut | Very strong (52M users prove it) |
| "Earn yield on crypto" | Crypto.com, Nexo | Moderate (yield wars erode differentiation) |
| "Simple crypto buying" | Cash App, Coinbase | Strong (mainstream trust) |
| "DeFi made accessible" | Zerion, Rainbow | Weak (DeFi is still scary) |
| "Spend crypto anywhere" | KAST, Wirex | Moderate (card partnerships) |
| "Financial inclusion" | Nubank, Mercado Pago | Very strong in LatAm |
| "Privacy-first finance" | — | Unclaimed (opportunity) |
| "Transparent fees" | — | Unclaimed (everyone hides fees) |
| "Your money, your proof" | — | Unclaimed (auditable reserves) |
| "Crypto for normies" | — | Partially claimed by Cash App |

**Unclaimed territories are the opportunity.** Look for needs that users express in reviews that no competitor claims on their website.

## 4. The "What NOT to Say" Framework

Overused positioning claims in crypto neobanks (as of 2026):

| Claim | Why It Fails |
|-------|-------------|
| "The future of finance" | Said by 200+ companies. Means nothing. |
| "Seamless experience" | Every fintech says this. Zero differentiation. |
| "Bank the unbanked" | Noble but vague. Doesn't tell users what you DO. |
| "Simple and secure" | Table stakes, not positioning. |
| "Next-generation banking" | Generation after what? Doesn't answer any question. |
| "Your money, your way" | Could be said by a mattress store. |
| "DeFi for everyone" | Scares mainstream users, bores crypto natives. |
| "Empowering financial freedom" | Pure buzzword soup. |
| "Revolutionary" | Nothing is. Stop it. |
| "Bridging TradFi and DeFi" | Technical jargon masquerading as a benefit. |

**The test:** Read the claim. Could any competitor in the space say the exact same thing? If yes, it's not positioning. It's wallpaper.

## 5. Messaging Hierarchy

For any positioning framework, the messaging hierarchy should be:

```
Level 1: Positioning Statement (internal, strategic)
    ↓
Level 2: One-Liner (external, 5-7 words, appears in hero)
    ↓
Level 3: Value Propositions (3 pillars, each with headline + proof)
    ↓
Level 4: Feature-Level Messaging (specific capabilities)
    ↓
Level 5: Audience-Specific Variants (same positioning, different language)
```

Each level must be derivable from the one above it. If your feature messaging contradicts your positioning statement, one of them is wrong.

## 6. Competitive Response Patterns

When positioning against a specific competitor:

**Never attack directly.** Instead:
- If competitor is bigger: "We built [specific thing] because [big company] wasn't going to."
- If competitor is more established: "For people who've outgrown [generic category]."
- If competitor is cheaper: "The [tool] that pays for itself." (Reframe cost as investment.)
- If competitor is more feature-rich: "Everything you need. Nothing you don't." (Simplicity as strength.)
- If competitor had a scandal: Don't mention it. Build trust through proof points (audits, transparency). The customer will make the connection.
