  "executive_summary": "Avici's core positioning asset is genuine: on-chain escrow smart contracts that let users spend via Visa without surrendering custody. No competitor in the direct set (Bleap, KAST, RedotPay) has this architecture. But the homepage buries it under generic 'spend crypto easily' messaging that fails the competitor test \u2014 every crypto card says the same thing.\n\nThe most powerful claims \u2014 self-custodial escrow contracts, internet neobank vision, YC startup treasury integration, virtual USD/EUR accounts \u2014 appear in docs and X posts but not on the primary conversion surface (avici.money). The homepage reads like a crypto card; the docs read like a bank.\n\nCompetitive landscape: Bleap is winning the value war with zero fees and up to 20% cashback. KAST owns multi-chain spending. RedotPay owns regulated stablecoin payments in Asia. None of them position as a full internet neobank. None lead with verifiable on-chain custody. This is the gap.\n\nKey risk: Avici's flagship 'Spend it, Don't Sell it' credit line feature is marked 'Coming Soon.' The fee structure is opaque (5% spread reported on conversions, up to 3% FX), and Google Play rating is 3.6/5 \u2014 suggesting product friction that undermines the positioning promise.\n\nRecommended bet: Own 'the self-custodial internet neobank.' Lead with the escrow architecture as the hero story. Expand messaging beyond card into full banking (payroll, savings, business). Build proof via transparency \u2014 publish contract addresses, spend data, fee breakdowns. Target crypto-native businesses and Solana power users first. Expand to mainstream later.",
